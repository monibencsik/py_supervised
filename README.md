#Comparison of the Wine dataset analysis with supervised machine learning models

The wine dataset contains 10 feature columns and 1 target column. During preprocessing the features were scaled with ##MinMaxScaler

Feature columns:
  fixed acidity
  volatile acidity
  citric acid
  residual sugar
  chlorides
  free sulfur dioxide
  total sulfur dioxide
  density
  pH
  sulphates
  alcohol

  
Target column: 
  quality


#Supervised Models
The following Supervised Machine Learning were applied

##Linear Regression

##Logistic Regression

##Decision Tree Classifier

##K Neighbour Classifier

##Support Vector Machine SVM

##AdaBoost


#Evaluation metrics
The algorithms were evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, mean standard error and mean absolute error.

#Visualization
For comparison, the results were tabulated and visualized with seaborn package


#Results
The metrics are somewhat low, which could be partially explained by the high number of classes in the quality target. Next steps could be to implement dimensionality reduction with clustering algorithms to assess if the metrics improve.
